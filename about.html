            <h3>I. Brief History of Title IX</h3>
            <p>Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (20 U.S.C. §1681 <i>et seq</i>.) was passed by the U.S. Congress
               on June 23, 1972. The federal civil rights law prohibits discrimination on the basiss of sex by any
               federally funded education programs or activities. This applies to most schools, covering approximately
               16,500 local school districts, 7,000 postsecondary institutions, as well as charter schools, for-profit schools,
               libraries, and museums.
             </p>
            <blockquote>“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in,
              be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving
              Federal financial assistance.” <br>—Title IX, Education Amendments of 1972
            </blockquote>

            <p>Schools are required to disseminate a notice of nondiscrimination, have a Title IX Coordinator, publish
              a grievance procedure outlining the complaint, investigation, and disciplinary process for addressing
              Title IX violations, and respond promptly to reports. </p>

            <h3>II. From Athletics to Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment</h3>
            <p>When Title IX was first added to the 1972 education reform bill, it was generally thought to affect hiring
              and employment practices at federally funded schools. The real intent of Title IX was to ensure equal access and
              opportunities for women in all facets of education. At that time, many universities either did not accept women
              or imposed a quota to limit female enrollment. There was also a huge barrier to participation for female athletes
              given little and uneven support from college athletic programs.
            </p>

            <p>While Title IX is most frequently associated with its impact on intercollegiate sports, its coverage and
              application has expanded over the last four decades. Alexander v. Yale, 631 F. 2d 178 (2d Cir. 1980) was the first
              Title IX case to argue and subsequently established  that sexual harassment is a form of sex discimination.
              The use of Title IX in addressing campus sexual assault and misconduct cases has become particularly significant
              in recent years.

            <h3>III. "Dear Colleague" Letter</h3>
            <p>On April 4, 2011, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) issued a <i>Dear Colleague</i> letter to
              over 7,000 schools outlining the requirements a school needs to take to address campus sexual harassment, including
              seuxal violence. The OCR also warned schools they could lose their federal funding if they did not take further
              measures to to prevent sexual violence.
            </p>
            <p>In 2014, the DOE released a list of schools under investigation for possible violation of federal law related to
              the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints, naming 55 colleges and universities. There are currently
              over 300 colleges and universities on the list (as of March, 2020).
