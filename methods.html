          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>This project is created as part of my thesis at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program
            to explore the use of creative medium and technology to build resilience and communities, especially in times
            when conventional means of protest is not feasible or when traditional ideas of recovery could not heal.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been interested in ways I can take apart complex systems and situations through building and working with
            datasets, and reinterpreting the information within through new frames of reference.
          </p>

            <h2>Data-Collection & Web Scraping</h2>
            <p>I first gathered the data on current open Title IX investigation from Office of Civil Rights’ “Pending Cases Currently
              Under Investigation at Elementary-Secondary and Post-Secondary Schools” as of March 17, 2020 Search. The data contains
              the institution name, State, institution type (element-secondary or post-secondary), and open investigation date.  (View Link)
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote Javascript and Python scripts using Puppeteer.js and Selenium to scrape data related to the institution’s tuition,
              institution type (private vs public), and physical coordinates, as well as Google Search images using the search terms
              “<i>Instuitution Name</i> + students”. After processing and cleaning the data, I visualized it using <i>DataTables</i> and <i>Leaflet.js</i>.

            <h2>Research & Interviews</h2>
            <p>Much of my understanding on the subject comes from my personal experience filing a Title IX complaint both at my institution
              and at the Department of Education. I revisited the reserach I did during that time, and also Kirby Dick’s documentary
              <i>The Hunting Ground</i> (View Link), which examines sexual assault on college campuses in the United States and the reported
              failure of college administrations to deal with it adequately.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had also interviewed several others who have filed Title IX complaints regarding their experience, as well as consult them
              on the design and implementation of this project.
